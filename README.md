# Computational Programming with C++

Welcome to the Computational Programming repository (CP)! This repository is dedicated to learning computational programming concepts using C++.

## Topics Covered
In this repository, you will find:
- **Hash Maps**: Introduction, operations (insertion, deletion, lookup), applications.
- **Arrays**: Basics, operations (accessing elements, resizing), applications.

These topics are covered through practical examples and exercises to help you understand these fundamental data structures in C++.

## Usage
To use the code in this repository:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anwarsayyad/CP.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd CP
   ```
   
3. Explore the directories `HashMap` and `Arrays` to find relevant examples and exercises.

4. Compile and run the C++ programs using your preferred C++ compiler.
